## Casa de Ranquines

A catholic NGO (Mace√≠o, Brazil, that runs various projects helping poor families and homeless people.

### Project

Deployed on Heroku: https://casa-de-ranquines.herokuapp.com/

This project's goal is to organize the internal administration of the NGO and facilitate its interaction with collaborators.

Before this project all the profiles on NGO's donors were ineffectively stored in Word and Excel files, which complicated the resource management.

This React application paired with a Node.js [backend](https://github.com/hlnstepanova/casa-de-ranquines-backend) will bring more structure and control to the internal affairs of the NGO.

* The search for a specific collaborator is realized via a search box (the secretary doesn't have to roam through the folders and Word documents anymore)
* A collaborator can be easily "activated" or "deactivated" on a button click.

* The anniversaries tab gives an overview of all the collaborators who have birthday in the current month.

* The motoboy won't need to call the secretary to ask for directions anymore, because a map with the location of the donor house is available in the collaborator's profile.
